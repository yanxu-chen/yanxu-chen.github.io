Research experience
======
* Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique, Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris (Dec 2018 until now)
  * Graduate student (research assistant)
  * Advisors: Sabrina Speich and Laurent Bopp
  * Project: The role of ocean mesoscale dynamics in the ocean heat and carbon uptake.

* EUREC4A campagne R/V L'Atalante, south of Barbados (Jan-Feb 2020)
  * Scientific crew member
  * Chief scientist: Sabrina Speich
  * Project: Deployment of several instruments and detection of homogeneous water masses with the proceeding shipborne data.

* Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, McGill University, Montréal (Sep 2016-Dec 2018)
  * Graduate student (research assistant)
  * Advisors: David Straub and Louis-Philippe Nadeau
  * Main project: Applied the flow-dependent nonlinear Ekman layer in a two-layer shallow water model and analyzed how the interior flow responds differently compared with the typical wind-induced shallow water model.

* Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton (May 2015-Sep 2015)
  * Summer research intern
  * Advisor: Paul Myers
  * Project: Compared several numerical simulations to understand the potential impact of freshwater processes and surface atmospheric conditions on the ocean and sea ice around Greenland. (Quantification includes mixed layer depth, ice thickness and fluxes through major straits.)
