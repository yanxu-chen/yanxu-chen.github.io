I play Guqin on a daily basis, which is a seven-string Chinese zither that has a history of about 3000 years. Traditionally, people play it outdoors in a mountain setting, a garden or a small pavilion. This quiet instrument has no more than 4 octaves, and a serene moonlit night is often considered an appropriate time for performance. You will also see it pretty much often in the Chinese ink brush paintings...

I guess it is true that every string instrument player is interested in music theory, as this is a tradition dating back to Pythagoras who used strings to support his idea that the planets move according to mathematical equations and thus resonate to produce a symphony of music. Traditionally, Guqin has a different and more complex system of musical temperament compared with the globally accepted equal temperament, which is much closer to just intonation and thus will never produce disharmony. As an "intuitive", I also believe that any musical scales describe a community/relation of tones and therefore the pitches in music are relative, not absolute. Ok so now I am countering physics :-) Recently, I have developed a computer program for Guqin to calculate the finger positions of each tone, given the musical modes or scales that the composers might need for writing pieces. Intuitively, this work is similar to adding frets to a guitar! Please contact me if you are interested in using it for composition.

* 離騷 (The Lament)
  * This piece was composed in late Tang Dynasty based on a poem with the same title authored by Qu Yuan (~300 BC). In short, I interpret this poem as his shamanistic imaginary journeys to escape from societal politics.

* 酒狂 (Drunken Ecstasy)
  * Not sure about the translation of such name, but I like it. Sometimes we make jokes that from a player's music, you will know what alcohol he/she drank.
