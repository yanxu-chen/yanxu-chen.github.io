I play Guqin on a daily basis, which is a seven-string Chinese instrument that has a history of about 3000 years. Traditionally, people play it outdoors in a mountain setting, a garden or a small pavilion. A serene moonlit night is considered an appropriate time for performance.

Some pieces
======
* 酒狂 (Drunken Ecstasy)
  * Not sure about the translation of such name, but I like it. Sometimes we make jokes that from a player's music, you will know what alcohol he/she drank.

* 關山月 (Moon over a Mountain Pass)
  * This short piece was composed after a poem of Li Bai (a romantic poet from the Tang Dynasty) that describes the emotions of soldies at the frontier fortress by depicting the scenery.
