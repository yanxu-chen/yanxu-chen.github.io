I play Guqin on a daily basis, which is a seven-string Chinese zither that has a history of about 3000 years. Traditionally, people play it outdoors in a mountain setting, a garden or a small pavilion. This quiet instrument has no more than 4 octaves, and a serene moonlit night is often considered an appropriate time for performance. You will also see it pretty much often in the Chinese ink brush paintings...

* 酒狂 (Drunken Ecstasy)
  * Not sure about the translation of such name, but I like it. Sometimes we make jokes that from a player's music, you will know what alcohol he/she drank.
