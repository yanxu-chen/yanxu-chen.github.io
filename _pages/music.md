I play Guqin on a daily basis, which is a seven-string Chinese instrument that has a history of about 3000 years. Traditionally, people play it outdoors in a mountain setting, a garden or a small pavilion. A serene moonlit night is considered an appropriate time for performance.

1. 酒狂(Drunken Ecstasy)
Not sure about the translation of such name, but I like it. Sometimes we make jokes that from a player's music, you will know what alcohol he/she drank.
