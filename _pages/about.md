Hi there, 
======
My name is Yanxu (妍旭) and I study ocean physics in general (maybe a bit metaphysics too). The spectrum of my curiosity is wide, but in specific, I try to understand the (sub)mesoscale characteristics of the upper ocean and their dynamical impacts on general ocean circulation and big-picture climate etc. Considering the two components (wind-driven and thermohaline) of ocean circulation, you can find my MSc study of the former related to nonlinear Ekman theory (and its interaction with near-inertial waves), and PhD work of the latter towards the correlation between mode water (ventilation) and mesoscale eddies. Details are shown in the [research page](https://yanxu-chen.github.io/research) and definitely more in our [publications](https://yanxu-chen.github.io/publications).
