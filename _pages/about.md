Hi there, 
======
My name is Yanxu (妍旭) and I study ocean physics in general (maybe a bit metaphysics too). The spectrum of my curiosity is wide, but specifically, I try to understand the mesoscale characteristics of the upper ocean and their dynamical impacts on general ocean circulation and big-picture climate. Considering the two interpretations (wind-driven and thermohaline) of ocean circulation, you can find my MSc study of the former related to nonlinear Ekman theory and its interplay with near-inertial waves, and PhD work of the latter towards the correlation between ventilation theory and mesoscale eddies in a Lagrangian framework. Details are shown in the [research page](https://yanxu-chen.github.io/research) and definitely more in our [publications](https://yanxu-chen.github.io/publications). Currently, I focus on air-sea interactions in polar regions. With regard to metaphysics, I am a disciple of Ludwig Wittgenstein and easily get obsessed with diverse topics in the philosophy of language and perception (i.e., linguistic boundaries of science).
