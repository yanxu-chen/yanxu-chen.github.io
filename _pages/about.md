Hi there, 
======
My name is Yanxu (妍旭) and I study ocean physics in general (and a bit metaphysics too). The spectrum of my curiosity is wide, but specifically, I try to understand the mesoscale characteristics of the upper ocean and their dynamical impacts on general ocean circulation and big-picture climate. Considering the two interpretations (wind-driven and thermohaline) of ocean circulation, you can find my MSc study of the former related to the nonlinear Ekman theory, and PhD work of the latter towards the correlation between ventilation theory and mesoscale eddies in both Lagrangian and Eulerian frameworks. Details are shown in the [research page](https://yanxu-chen.github.io/research) and definitely more in our [publications](https://yanxu-chen.github.io/publications). Currently, I focus on air-sea interactions in polar regions. With regard to metaphysics, I am a disciple of Ludwig Wittgenstein and thus easily get obsessed with diverse topics in the philosophy of language, mathematics and perception (i.e., the linguistic boundaries of physical and physiological knowledge).
