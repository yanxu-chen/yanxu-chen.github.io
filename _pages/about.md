Hi there, 
------
My name is Yanxu (妍旭) and I study ocean physics in general (maybe a bit metaphysics too). The spectrum of my curiosity is wide, but in specific, I try to understand the (sub)mesoscale characteristics of the upper ocean and their dynamical impacts on general ocean circulation and big-picture climate etc. Considering the two components (wind-driven and thermohaline) of ocean circulation, you can find my MSc study of the former related to nonlinear Ekman theory (and its interaction with near-inertial waves), and PhD work of the latter towards the correlation between mode water (ventilation) and mesoscale eddies. Details are shown in the [research page](https://yanxu-chen.github.io/research) and definitely more in our [publications](https://yanxu-chen.github.io/publications). 




I use both observations and modeling to study the physical questions that arouse my curiosity, which, to interpret in another way, have trained me into a Kant (the philosopher). But by nature (or some unknown reason), I see myself as a piece of material that highly resonates with Mr. Nietzsche. In other words, I am more ambitious in art than in science. As I understand, the job of physicists is to drag physics from the pool of metaphysics, referring the latter to be a premise for the former. Whereas in the field of art, everything is more complicated. People usually associate art to sentiments. However, I am not a fan of this idea. I always find “metaphysics” and “subjectivity” two fascinating notions in philosophy. Then, similar to rationality in physical science, I think to express sentiments in art is the tool/representation of metaphysics.  


Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section


Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
