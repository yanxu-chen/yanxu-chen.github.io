Nonlinear Ekman theory
======
Classic Ekman theory applied to the ocean surface layer predicts a transport perpendicular to the wind stress and inversely proportional to the Coriolis frequency, &f. A modification to this has that the transport is instead inversely proportional to the absolute vertical vorticity, f+Î¶ (Stern, 1965). This modification has recently been extended to curvilinear currents by Wenegrat and Thomas (2017).
