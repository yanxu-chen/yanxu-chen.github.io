Nonlinear Ekman theory
======

Classic Ekman theory applied to the ocean surface layer predicts a transport perpendicular to the wind stress and inversely proportional to the Coriolis frequency, *f*. A modification to this has that the transport is instead inversely proportional to the absolute vertical vorticity, *f+Î¶* [(Stern, 1965)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0011-7471(65)90007-0). This modification has recently been extended to curvilinear currents by [Wenegrat and Thomas (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-16-0239.1).

We extend these studies by firstly considering a uniform zonal wind stress acting on an axisymmetric balanced eddy, namely, a cyclonic or anticyclonic vortex. The equation below lists the advection terms that we consider. Since a time-dependent term is retained in the Ekman equations, the need of shifting from Cartesian coordinate to curvilinear coordinate is eliminated.
