Nonlinear Ekman theory
======

Classic Ekman theory applied to the ocean surface layer predicts a transport perpendicular to the wind stress and inversely proportional to the Coriolis frequency, *f*. A modification to this has that the transport is instead inversely proportional to the absolute vertical vorticity, *f+Î¶* [(Stern, 1965)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0011-7471(65)90007-0). This modification has recently been extended to more complex curvilinear currents by [Wenegrat and Thomas (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-16-0239.1).

Following these studies, we first consider a zonally uniform wind stress acting on an axisymmetric balanced eddy (either cyclonic or anticyclonic). The equation below describes several advection terms in consideration, where *u0* indicates the background velocity of the given vortex. Since a time-dependent term is retained in this Ekman equation, the need of shifting from Cartesian coordinate to a curvilinear coordinate is eliminated.

The video below shows Ekman pumping (or divergence of horizontal transport) for three cases: <br />
a) upper panels that only consider advection 1; <br />
b) middle panels that take into account both advections 1 and 2; <br />
c) lower panels for a fully nonlinear result. <br />

Accounting for a balanced curvilinear flow leads to counter-intuitive conclusions, e.g., that the Ekman transport need not to be everywhere perpendicular to the applied stress. In addition, our model allows for transients, as shown in the video. By adding the "real" nonlinear advection term (bottom panels), the signals of pumping are pushed southward. 

A more complex system, i.e., this slab Ekman layer coupled with a two-layer shallow water model can be found in our paper: [Interaction of Nonlinear Ekman Pumping, Near-Inertial Oscillations, and Geostrophic Turbulence in an Idealized Coupled Model](https://yanxu-chen.github.io/publication/2021-03-01-Ekman)
